# Bash Tokenizer written in Rust
## Goal
The goal of this Rust project is to fully tokenize/perform lexical analysis for [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html).
We'll be doing this in a couple of stages, the current milestone is full support for Vol. 3 Ch. 2 : Shell Command Language [IEEE 1003.1 2024](https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/1003.1/7700/)

## Status
This project is in it's initial stages, so nothing is really working just yet. We'll update this as we go along.
